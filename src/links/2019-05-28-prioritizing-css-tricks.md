A nice change of pace to read a general productivity article from someone working in development.

How many of us are guilty of sacrificing quality time elsewhere for the sake of work, especially easy as an freelancer:

> what you work on informs your values. You may think it’s no big thing to work overtime for a little while, but something will be sacrificed with this decision.

> where you invest your time is not just about what you value, but also what you don’t value.

Countering the view that a productive session stems from tackling the biggest/hardest/most valuable task first:

> Part of the reason we do the small things first is that morale is important. I feel more incensed to get my other work done because being productive feels good — there's a small dopamine rush associated with every check.

I use Bullet Journaling for similar sense of accomplishment:

> Alice Goldfuss: "I have a kanban board for my personal life todo list and a cron job that empties my Done column and texts it to me every week, so I feel accomplished"

Knowing yourself is the crucial factor in any personal productivity system:

> Most of these systems work for me because I know my strengths and weaknesses and I play to them: I work more efficiently when things are broken down into steps. I work best when my work has the most meaning, and I remove the cruft. I work best when I work along with, not against, my energy levels, where possible.

And for days like today:

> There’s one more thing I haven't addressed yet: forgiveness. You’ll be more productive on some days (or hell, even years!) than you will be on others, and that's OK. Life is full of ebbs and flows.
