There's an impressive depth of consideration here for such a visually small component. For bonus points, substitute _toast(s)_ for any other website feature you can think of: 

> Toasts are a pattern best used carefully and only after testing with users â€” your users and their technologies. If you opt to build toasts, be certain your timelines account for accessibility testing. If you instead use toasts from a third-party, then be even more certain your timelines account for accessibility testing and potentially changing to a different third party solution.
