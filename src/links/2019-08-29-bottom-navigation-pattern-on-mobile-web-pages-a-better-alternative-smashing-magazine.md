The hamburger menu is so engrained in the minds of clients and those that make websites, it's not going anywhere anytime soon. That's a shame as the stats speak for themselves:

> hidden navigation (hamburger menu) significantly decreases user experience both on mobile and desktop. On mobile, people used the hidden navigation in 57% of the cases, and the combo navigation in 86% of the cases, i.e. 1.5 times more!

If you want your content to be seen, reduce the barriers to entry.
