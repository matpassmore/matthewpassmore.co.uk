An empassioned plea that we take aim at favicon madness:

> The ideal situation, my wish, is that we, our field, define and push for a simple standard: a favicon.svg (with browsers falling back to favicon.png and then favicon.ico) that sits at respective site root and is not required to be referenced from the markup.
