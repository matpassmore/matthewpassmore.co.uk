Some painful project deadlines made for a baron month of screentime:

{% reviews %}

1. “**Tour de France**” (TV event) 

    An epic few weeks of racing. Gutted for fellow countryman Geraint though second place is hell of an achievement. E Bernal is something else on those mountains though.

2. “**[After Life](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8398600/)**” (TV series 2019) 

    I choked up every episode without fail. A genuine warmth underpins the dark humour.

3. “**[Surviving America's Most Hated Family](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10639076/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_1)**” (TV documentary 2019) 

    L Theroux navigates his rage-enducing subjects with typical poise and intelligence.

4. “**Escape from History**” (2017) 

    The Manic Street Preachers recount the recording and release of Everything Must Go. Taken back to my younger self. A magical time, especially for Welsh bands.

5. “**[Adventureland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091722/)**” (2009) 

    Rewatched. I'm a sucker for coming-of-age films with an eighties backdrop. Job done.

My work patterns shape my listening habits. This month was all about the search for flow states which means vocals are a no-go. Looping beats and melodies are the order of the day. A charismatic Glastonbury performance from Stormzy drew me into his sphere though:

1. “**Singularity**” (Jon Hopkins 2018) 

    On. Repeat. My most listened to album of 2018, according to Spotify, keeps on giving.

2. “**I See You**” (The xx 2017) 

    One of my go-tos when visiting London on my lonesome for work. Feels right.

3. “**Everything Must Go**” (Manic Street Preachers 1996) 

    Revisited after watching documentary above. It stands the test of time.

4. “**Truth is a Beautiful Thing**” (London Grammar 2017) 

    This is a beautiful thing (with the headphones on, in particular).

5. “**Seven Days Walking (Day 5)**” (Ludovico Einaudi 2019) 

    For when the ears tired of beats. You know what to expect with Einaudi but he does it so damn well.

6. “**Emerald Rush - Solomun Remix**” (Jon Hopkins, Solomun 2019) 

    A remix that stands up to the original.

7. “**Gang Signs & Prayer**” (Stormzy 2017) 

    This boy has chops. His talent outruns the production at times but no doubt it will all come together soon. Potential for Kendrick-esque musical heights.

8. “**A Bath Full of Ecstasy**” (Hot Chip 2019) 

    My soft spot for this rabble continues.
